	NOTES for using the SKick program with the GVP A530 Turbo 
	=========================================================

These notes were written after some experiences with the GVP A530 Turbo Harddisk.

SKick was tested on a machine with following configuration:

	- Amiga A500+, 2.04 ROM, 2Megs of Chip RAM
	- GVP A530 Turbo Harddisk 120MB, CPU 68EC030, no FPU, 5 MB 32bit RAM.

On this system, SKick works fine. FASTRES option may be specified without 
problems. Skick doesn't do anything with A530's 'pseudo-MMU', it is turned off
during reboot. Care must be taken to remove GVPCpuCtrl command with FASTROM
option from Startup-Sequence. This command causes that the image loaded by SKick
doesn't survive reboot. Both caches may be turned on in burst mode as usual.

	Do You see unusual memory capacity 5 Megs of 32 bit RAM ?
Yes, You're thinking right, this capacity is obtained by installing 1 piece
of 4 Meg SIMM into the system and reinstalling the original 1 Meg one to the
second, free socket. The jumpers must be set to the position '4 M SIMMs'.
After this is done, system reports 8 Megs of expansion RAM. This is of course
wrong. The problem is that the GVP hardware doesn't recognize our cheat and
the system memory check is too primitive to find it. When this situation
is not handled by additional software support, system will crash after filling
the first 'real' 5 Megs. Skick from the release 3.33 handles this situation
correctly. Special switch CORR5M is added to support it. When specified, it re-
moves extra 3 Megs from the end of the expansion memory space. Note that various
tools will report the board as 8 Meg even with this option active, but Avail
or any other memory checking tool will report 5 Megs correctly.
