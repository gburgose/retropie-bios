         ===========================================================

These notes were written after debugging SKick to operate correctly on the
A1200 machine.

Skick was debugged on a plain A1200 with following configuration:

	- CPU 68020, no FPU, no MMU
	- 2 Meg Chip RAM, no other RAM
	- 80M Maxtor Hard Drive supplied by GVP

On this machine, two troubles have occured against the A500/600.

1)  OS  3.0 normally allocates its supervisor stack from the top of Chip RAM, if
no Fast RAM is available.  This prevents SKick from loading the kickstart to the
top of RAM, and it is loaded 1/2M below, instead.  This causes RAM fragmentation
and decreases the largest available block size.  To avoid this problem, RELSTACK
option  has  been  added  to  the SKick.  When active, this option allocates new
space  for  the  supervisor  stack from the public memory and moves the stack to
this  new place, finally freeing the original memory and making it available for
the kickstart.

2)  When  loading  kickstarts  not designed for A1200, they will not support the
A1200  specific  hardware  like  HD, PCMCIA etc.  It is the case of the 1.3 sys-
tem.   In  this  case,  only  the diskette drives will be usable.  No simple way
exists  to  solve  this problem, only to write new devices support for the obso-
lete  OS.   A1200  hardware  hasn't the form of expansion boards, it is simply a
part  of its ROM, so there is not a possibility to transfer the hardware support
to the RAM kickstart like in a case of a standard expansion board.
