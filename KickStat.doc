                       =================================

                               ================

This little utility has been written to help SKick users with various problems
when  using  SKick.   It  issues a diagnostic output telling the status of the
kickstart  image,  where it is located, if its memory is contained in MemList,
if the image is protected and by which means etc.
The second purpose of this utility is to shutdown the RAM kickstart. This ope-	
ration is done using the total system reset, similar to power-on, which will
totally clear all the system and nothing will survive it. To do it, use the
optional SHUTDOWN parameter. This one works only if the RAM kickstart is detec-
ted. It is ignored if the system currently operates from ROM.

Explaining of KickStat messages follows:

'KickStat version ?.?, (C) SinSoft 1993'
- a simple copyright message

'Running R?M kickstart, version ?.?'
- there is the memory type of the kickstart image (ROM/RAM) and the
  kickstart version written there.  Note that RAM kickstarts mapped to $F80000
  are considered to be the ROM ones.

'Skick resident module not found.'
- Skick is not active on this system. Either it was not started or it was
  shut down by various circumstances (deep crash, power off/on, possibly a bug).
  If this message is issued, program terminates.

'SKick version string not found.'
- A very old version of SKick is used which hasn't a version string inside its
  resident module.

'Kicked by ......'
- The kicking program name and version is written here. Currently, KickStat 
  recognizes the Skick's resident module only.

'Skick MemTag is located at ???????? (length ????????).'
- The address and length of the Skick resident module is written there.

'Kickstart image is located at ???????? (length ????????).'
- The address and length of kickstart image is written there.

'Kickstart memory is [not] contained in MemList.'
- This message explains if the kickstart image is allocated at the memory
  contained normally in the system memory pool or not.
  If it isn't, the following messages about the kickstart protection aren't
  issued except the immediately following one which must say 'NOT'.

'Kickstart image is [not] protected by MemTag.'
- This message explains if the SKick's automatic kickstart image protection 
  is used or not.

'Kicstart image allocated OK.'
- This message says that all about the kickstart image allocation is done right.

'Kickstart image is unprotected, trying to protect it.'
- KickStat found unprotected kickstart image and tries to protect it. It may be
  the result of using the Skick's 'FORCE' option with standard or autoconfig
  memory or with non-autoconfig memory added to the system later.

'Kickstart image protection OK.'
- The result of the operation described above was successful.

'Kickstart image protection failed, system unstable !!!'
- The result of the operation described above was unsuccessful. Normally, there
  is no reason why the allocation may fail, so this message will be seen very
  rarely.

'WARNING: Kickstart memory protection error, system unstable !!!'
- KickStat found during its memory scan, that the kickstart image is PARTIALLY
  allocated, i.e. that a part of its area is allocated, another part is free.
  This message is very important; if it is issued, reboot your system or you may
  await crash very soon.

'Kickstart checksum is valid.'
- I think it is self-explanatory.

'WARNING: Kickstart checksum is corrupted, reboot immediately !!!'
- The kickstart image has corrupted checksum. Something trashed at least one
  byte of the kickstart image. It cannot be considered as reliable furthermore.
  An immediate reboot is *VERY* recommended unless you know the cause of this.
