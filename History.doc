                     History log for Skick program
                     =============================
                          (C) SinSoft 1992,93


3.46 (139.132 - 21.1.07)
=======================
1) added A600 kick 40063 RTB (provided by Bert Jahn)

3.45 (139.131 - 21.3.03)
=======================
1) added A4000 kick 40068 RTB/PAT (import from MKick)

3.44 (139.130)
=======================
1) added A1200 kick 40068 RTB/PAT (import from MKick)

3.43 (139.129 - 21.6.93)
========================
1) Kickstart 40.38 support files added to the archive.
2) Kickstart 33.180 (classic 1.2 ROM) support files added to the archive.
It was done after many requirements from users. However, I'm afraid that
programs which require 1.2 and don't run under 1.3 are the dirty ones which
jump into the ROM directly and that they will not work under kicked 1.2, too.
Note also that 1.2 ROM hasn't booting from any other device than DF0:, so 
don't be surprised when the hand with disk will be displayed.
3) Found a little bug in 1.3 ROM rtb file (kick34005.a500.rtb). Fixed.
4) Found a little bug in SKick causing bogus gadgets to be displayed when 10
kickstart images were found. Fixed. 

3.42 (139.128 - 24.5.93)
========================
CPU caches are correctly flushed and disabled during the SKick's installation
including CopyBack caches. Maybe SKick will work on '040 systems from now ???

3.41 (139.127 - 20.5.93)
========================
SKick now refuses to kick any ReKick type image without the appropriate .PAT
file, because it never works and it always crashes the machine only. NOPATCH
option is ignored in such a case.

3.40 (139.126 - 8.5.93)
=======================
ADDMEM option added. This option allows adding a non-autoconfig memory board 
during the kicking process. Please read the manual for the complete information.
ADR option modified. Now, the address may be given by its upper word only (for
the compatibility with previous releases) as well as by the whole long number.
Dollar sign as an optional hex number symbol removed - shell was confused by it
and tried to interpret the number as an environment variable.
The built-in number parser enriched with the minus sign, allowing negative
numbers to be entered, and with underline symbol with the meaning of the decimal
number prefix. Both these symbols may be combined.
Bug in AllocKick program fixed. It caused the malfunction in the case of the
board lying above $1000000.
A little program called KickStat added to the archive. It prints a lot of
information about the kickstart image and its status. It may be also used as
the kickstart image allocator.

3.35 (139.125 - 25.4.93)
========================
1) Automatic kickstart memory allocation is disabled when the FORCE switch is 
used. This option is designed for use with non-autoconfigured memory boards. 
Standard kickstart image protection is done using the MemTag, and it causes 
malfunction of MemTag/RomTag logic because the memory is not added to the system
at the Mem/RomTag scanning time yet. Users should allocate kickstart image by
other means, for example using supplied 'AllocKick' program.
2) DEBUG option is introduced in this release. Please read the doc. 
3) The bug is fixed causing crashes when hard-loading kickstart above the
temporary buffer when the buffer overlapped with the destination.
4) 40.9 .RTB/.PAT files for both A4000 and A600/A1200 kickstart types added to
the archive.

3.34 (139.124 - 15.2.93)
========================
Corrected the bug preventing the 2.0+ kickstart files from being run from
32-bit address space (above $1000000). SKick should now work fine with products
like the A5000 accelerator with non-autoconfig 32bit RAM (options ADR XXXX and
FORCE should be used) or with Zorro-III memory boards (option 32BIT should be
used).
Fixed the bug causing illegal FreeMems at unusual situations (like error re-
turns). Cleanup code made cleaner.
40.3 .RTB/.PAT files for both A3000 and A600/A1200 kickstart types added to
the archive (19.3.93).

3.33 (139.123 - 29.1.93)
========================
1) More kickstart file sanity checks added. Now the length is tested and if
it is less than $80000 (except $40000 exactly) the error message is issued
and the file is not processed. The same will happen, if the file length is
greater than $80000, but less than $80800. Beginning with this length, the
file is processed as the A3000 SuperKickstart file (with Magic/Bonus) and
the rest of file above $80000 is cut off automatically.
2) CORR5M option added. This option is useless for the most of users except
owners of GVP A530 Turbo Harddisk. Those may buy 4M expansion memory modules
(SIMMs) to expand original 1M capacity of 32bit RAM. The manufacturer doesn't
recommend mixing of 1M and 4M modules; if it is done (4M one must be the first,
1M one the 2nd), system reports 8 Megs of total capacity, but physically it has
5 Megs with the last one Meg mirrorred 4 times. CORR5M option allows to use
this configuration by correcting the BoardSize item of the memory board's
ConfigDev structure to the correct 5 Megs.
3) 39.115 kickstart .RTB/.PAT added to the archive. Please read 39115.README
for more information.

3.32 (139.122 - 18.1.93)
========================
KILLTAGS option included. This option allows to kill all the KickTags and 
MemTags as well as CoolCapture vector before installing SKick's ones.
This ensures that the machine is clear when the new kickstart starts. Note
that this is done automatically when kicking 1.3 system (there is a risk of
incompatibility of the modules available for 2.0 only (like NewAlert)) or
when performing hard-load (risk that the modules or their parts are located
in memory occupied by kickstart image later).

3.31 (139.121 - 17.1.93)
========================
1) FASTRES option added. It allows the resident module space to be allocated
in Fast RAM instead of Chip RAM. However, if 1.3 system is kicked, or if 
there isn't enough fast ram to contain the module, Chip RAM is used again.
This option may cause crashes under certain conditions; if it is Your case,
don't use it.
2) Skick now searches for the memory for kickstart image in 1/4 Meg steps.
Formerly, it was done in steps equal to the kickstart size. It allows the
image to be loaded out of alignment specified by its size (for example, 1/2M
kickstart can be loaded to $X40000 or $XC0000 automatically).

3.30 (139.120 - 7.1.93)
=======================
Four bugs fixed: 
1) Bug in memory allocation which caused toggling between 2.0 and 1.3
after a reset and malfunction of expansion boards; this bug appeared under 
very special circumstances only and was hard to find. Thanks to Marc Heuler
which first (and only) reported this.
2) Bug also in memory allocation which caused accidental system crash if 
'hard load' method was used. This bug was discovered during debugging process
of the previous one.
3) When GUI was activated by the mouse, switches from cmdline (like NOREL)
weren't updated from GUI screen if the user didn't refresh them manually.
Thanks to -jis- for the report.
4) Alert timing feature of the new 39.106+ OS is correctly maintained by SKick
and value saved during a reboot; older revisions of Skick didn't do it so alerts
weren't displayed at all!
Additions:
RELSTACK option added to allow easy kicking on 3.0 based systems with Chip RAM
only (see manual and SKickOnA1200.txt)
From now, SKick should work on an A1200 !

3.22 (139.119 - 15.12.92)
=========================
Added the option 32BIT to allow searching for the RAM space above $1000000.
However, this is not recommended for general use - it was added only for the
testing purposes, what will happen if kickstarts are loaded to such space.

3.21 (139.118 - 11.12.92)
=========================
Added the ability to load coded kickstart images from GUI mode too
(I forgot to add this to the previous release :-( )

3.20 (139.117 - 10.12.92)
=========================
Added the ability to load coded kickstart images. Use of Recode
program not needed now! Reloc table for BETA 39106 (kick39106.BETA.RTB) added
to the archive. Table names changed: there may be an additional suffix before
RTB/PAT to specify what kind of kickstart it is made for.
To avoid crashes when using reloc/patch tables not for the kickstart they were
made for, file formats have changed. The first long of .RTB and .PAT tables now
contains checksum of the kickstart image they are made for. When incorrect
kickstart is used, error message 'Incorrect reloc/patch table used' is issued
and kicking is terminated.

3.12 (139.116 - 9.12.92)
========================
Correction made for true 3.0 ROMs (like one for A1200) to be kickable.
Reloc table for A1200 ROM (kick39106.A1200.RTB) included to the archive.
/NOT SENT/RELEASED TO ANYBODY/

3.12 (139.115 - 8.12.92)
========================
Ranger Rescue facility added. Allows use of Ranger ($C0) memory which is nor-
mally destroyed by destructive memory test during system init. 
Only first part of Ranger memory remains unusable. Please load kickstarts
at least from $C40000. /NOT SENT/RELEASED TO ANYBODY/

3.11 (139.114 - 7.12.92)
========================
1.3 image allocation improved. Now uses AllocAbs if possible (ExRAM) instead 
of MemList manipulation. /NOT SENT/RELEASED TO ANYBODY/

     (139.113 - 7.12.92)
     ===================
Bugs fixed. Memory allocation code and loading procedures simplified and
improved. /NOT SENT/RELEASED TO ANYBODY/

     (139.112 - 7.12.92)
     ===================
Bugs fixed.
39.110 A500/600 BETA ROM .RTB and .PAT included into archive.
/NOT SENT/RELEASED TO ANYBODY/

3.10 (139.111 - 6.12.92)
========================
Some bugs fixed. MemTag handling improved, protection against MemTag corrup-
tion added (caused destruction of MemTag part by other ones such RAD or 
Early Startup). Relocatable patch facility added. /NOT SENT/RELEASED TO ANYBODY/

3.01 (139.100 - ?.11.92)
========================
First distributed release.

2.XX (137.XXX)
==============
Versions without GUI.

1.XX (134.XXX)
==============
Single-purpose programs to kick 1.3 system only.
Some of those versions are ILLEGALLY walking around the world, including the
patched kickstart image (which needed this) under the names ReloKick1.3, Boot1.3,
Kick!1.3 and many more. I never gave the rights to distribute them to anybody!
These programs were my very first attempts to use 1.3 on my new A500+ and they are
VERY primitive (for example, they don't handle expansion boards). If You have any
of these programs, ERASE THEM IMMEDIATELY !!!
