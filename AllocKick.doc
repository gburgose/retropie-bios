NOTE:   Beginning  with  V3.40  of  SKick,  users may add their non-autoconfig
memory  boards  using  the  new  SKick  feature,  ADDMEM.  Usefullness of this
program  is lowered by this change.  Please read the full SKick doc how to use
the ADDMEM option!


This  very little utility was written to help SKick users with non- autoconfig
memory  boards.   With these, SKick should be used with FORCE option to ensure
loading onto memory unknown to the system and to avoid automatic allocation of
the kickstart image, which is unusable in such a case.  This causes the effect
of the kickstart image being unprotected and easily overwritten by any program
requiring a lot of memory.

Recommended usage of the program is as follows:

In Your startup-sequence, put the following commands in the following order: 

SKick .... FORCE
AddMem ....
AllocKick
...

These  three  commands should be at the top of the startup-sequence before any
other commands (SetPatch etc).

AllocKick  does  not  require  any  parameters and doesn't print any messages.
After  successful  allocating,  return  code  is set to 0.  When unsuccessful,
AllocKick returns 5.

Users  with  standard  Zorro-II or Zorro-III autoconfig boards don't need this
program because the memory allocation should be done by SKick automatically.
